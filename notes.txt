functions: functions that aren't the main commands 
commands: the commands listed in the lab instructions

(this was just the first way I thought of organizing it, it's easy to change if it doesn't make sense)

I made list and exit both just print out the file names that are in FILENAME_MAP and then exit will exit the function. 
-we need to make list also print out the size of the file but I didn't have time to finish that part. I have an idea about just storing the size to make it easy though

clarification questions:
what needs to be removed when a file is removed?
